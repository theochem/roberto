Work flow

Roberto divides the continuous integration process into
smaller "tasks", which are listed by ``rob --help`` and which are defined in
``roberto/tasks.py``:

.. include:: tasks_generated.rst.inc

When ``rob`` is executed without arguments, the **quality** task is executed,
which runs all the tests related to the in-placed build. You may provide one or
more task names as positional command-line arguments to change this behavior.
The **robot** task is a more complete test and runs all tasks except for
**nuke-testenv**, so also including the packaging.

The tasks **sanitize-git**, **setup-testenv**, **install-requirements** and
**nuke-testenv** are less configurable than the other tasks. They take care
of a proper development environment for the remaining tasks, except for
**nuke-testenv** which does exactly the opposite.

The other tasks are more configurable through ``.roberto.yml``. In this file,
you specify which software packages need to be built and which tools should be
used in each task. More details can be found in :ref:`configuration`.

When Roberto starts, it will also run ``git describe --tags`` to determine the
current version. It is assumed that git tags are complete `semantic version
numbers <https://semver.org>`_. The expected format of a tag is just three
numbers separated by dots, *not* prefixed with a ``v``. Suffixes for alpha (dev),
beta (test) and post releases are supported in line with
`PEP404 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/>`_.
Roberto will fail when the last tag does not follow these conventions. The
version information can be used in all tasks. The most prominent one is
**write-version**, which can write updated version files.

For development purposes, it is often sufficient to run ``rob quality`` to
perform all code quality checks or ``rob build-inplace`` to prepare a working
in-place compilation. The latter will also generate a file
``activate-*-dev-*.sh``, which can be sourced to load all the environment
variables that will activate the in-place build for further testing.
