##########

- Version 2.0.4 May 6, 2023

  - Update of Python versions in documentation and source.

- Version 2.0.3 Jun 13, 2022

  - Use strings for Python version in `.github/workflow` files.
    (Changed in documentation and Roberto's own CI files.)

- Version 2.0.2 Oct 18, 2021

  - Upgrade pip before using it.

- Version 2.0.1 Oct 18, 2021

  - Fix `nuke-testenv` for conda.
  - Minor documentation and output improvements.
  - Use f-strings in source code.
  - Fix few new types of pylint issues.

- Version 2.0.0 Mar 20, 2021

  - Support for two types of test environments: conda and venv. (It is also
    possible not to activate any environment.) The default is venv, which is
    the fastest of the two. venv does not support all features of Roberto, but
    can handle most.
  - Support for two types of package managers: conda and pip. (Obviously,
    conda can only be used in a conda environment.)
  - Improved output readability.
  - All CI tools have corresponding classes in `roberto/tools.py`.
  - Improved activate script handling.
  - Many small fixes.
  - Switch from Travis to Github Actions.

  - Fix issue with building for python != 3.7.

- Version 1.3.0 March 26, 2019

  - Option to add project-specific extra requirements, which may be convenient
    when using certain Sphinx extensions. This was also possible in the previous
    version by rewriting the corresponding `build-docs` tool, but this was a
    rather cumbersome approach.
  - Documentation improvements, also for the CI setup on Travis.
  - conda* packages are installed and updated in the base environment. This
    makes sure the most up-to-date versions are used. Upgrading them in a
    sub-environment may have no effect.
